# Yacht & boat clubs

I wanted to create an easily accessible collection of yacht and boat club information. Yacht and boat clubs without official websites (or Facebook), or without a burgee, will not be included.

The clublist.yml file contains a list of yachting and boating clubs, with the following information:

* Name
* City
* State
* Country
* Date founded
* Website
* Burgee (name of associated image file)

The images directory contains the burgee image for each club.
I'm using the data to create a modern website listing clubs across the US. Visit [ycburgees.com](https://www.ycburgees.com).

## Status

I'm focusing on clubs in the US first. Clubs in the following states have been added:

* Rhode Island
* Maine
* Vermont
* New Hampshire
* Connecticut
* Massachusetts

## Contact & usage

If you are a member of a yacht or boat club who has stumbled on this page and would like to add or remove your club, correct any information, or provide a high quality burgee image for your club, email ycburgees@gmail.com

This data is here for anyone's convenience.
